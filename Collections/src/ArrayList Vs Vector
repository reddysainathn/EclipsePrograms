ArrayList is not synchronized.
	ArrayList is fast because it is non-synchronized.
ArrayList uses Iterator interface to traverse the elements.
	ArrayList increments 50% of current array size if number of element exceeds from its capacity.


Vector is synchronized.

	Vector increments 100% means doubles the array size if total number of element exceeds than its capacity.
	
Vector is slow because it is synchronized i.e. in multithreading environment,
 it will hold the other threads in runnable or non-runnable state until current thread releases the lock of object.
 
 	Vector uses Enumeration interface to traverse the elements. But it can use Iterator also.
