The exception handling in java is one of the powerful mechanism 
to handle the runtime errors so that normal flow of the application can be maintained.

There are two types of exception,

1.Checked Exception

The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions e.g.IOException, SQLException etc. 
Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.


2.Unchecked Exception

The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. 
Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time rather they are checked at runtime.
